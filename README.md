# Scotch Bonnet

This is a draft font in progress. It exists in part to exercise the new [Runebender] font editor.

The design is an update of the classic [Scotch Roman] style. I'm trying to take particular inspiration from the 1813 Miller specimen, from which I've obtained additional scans from the [St Bride Library]. At the same time, I'm trying to update it for modern usage. One goal in particular is an alternate choice for TeX documents currently using Computer Modern. Note that the latter font also has a historical lineage through the Miller.

Right now, the glyph set is sparse, and I'm still in the process of calibrating the design parameters and choosing the curve technology (I might switch to [hyperbezier splines]). Ultimately I'd like a weight and optical size axis, and an italic complement. When these decisions are a bit more firm, I will happily accept contributions, particularly to expand the character set, but for now is best considered a personal project.
